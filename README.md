# Welcome to VibeCheck! ðŸŽ¶

VibeCheck is a **spontaneous music-based social media app**, similar to the popular app **BeReal**. It encourages users to share **one song** they're currently listening to at a random time during the day. The app fosters a sense of authenticity and spontaneous social interaction by prompting users to post at a random time, allowing them to see what their friends are listening to in the moment.

This app is **still a work in progress**, with ongoing development to enhance functionality, improve user experience, and scale the backend. Stay tuned for more updates!

## Purpose

The main goal of VibeCheck is to create a fun, organic environment for users to connect over music. Unlike traditional social media platforms, the randomness and music-sharing focus help build more authentic interactions among friends. Whether you're vibing to a new track or rediscovering an old favorite, VibeCheck brings a fresh twist to music-based social media.

## Getting Started

To see the current state of VibeCheck locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install all necessary dependencies for the project by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Expo App

In the "MusicBeReal" directory, you can start the Expo app by running:

```bash
cd MusicBeReal
npx expo start
```

### 3. Start the Backend Server

This project also includes a backend server to manage user posts and interactions, as well as fetching song information for posting. To run the server, navigate to the server directory and start the Node.js server:

```bash
cd server
node server.ts
```

## Work In Progress

Please note that VibeCheck is an ongoing project, and I am continuously adding new features and improving existing ones. Some features may be in early stages or subject to change. I hope to have VibeCheck published to the app store by early june :)
